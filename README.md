# Universal On/Off Remote made to shut down or power on most TVs and such.
#15m of range(1 IR LED)
#equipped with dynamic delay, using a potentiometer you are able to adjust how fast the IR signals get sent out.
#LEDs for visualized output (1 LED matching dynamic delay for easier tuning)
#!!this is only V3 future upgrades will be made!!
#Zero use of AI in the process of coding

#known bugs in the V3:
-Dynamic LED stops responding when IR signals are being sent.

#Components used in the project:
-Arduino Nano
-Jumper Cables
-10k Ohm resistor
-3, 220 Ohm resistors
-Push button
-940nm IR LED (10-20 degrees)
-3 LED, different colors for visual feedback
-Potentiometer
-2n2222 NPN
